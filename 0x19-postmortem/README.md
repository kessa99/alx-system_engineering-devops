A postmortem is a detailed analysis or report that is conducted after an incident, such as a system outage, failure, or a project issue. It aims to identify the root causes of the incident, understand what went wrong, and outline the steps taken to resolve the issue. The term "postmortem" is often used in the context of engineering, technology, and project management to reflect on the incident and learn from it to prevent similar issues in the future.

In the context of technology and engineering, a postmortem typically includes:

Issue Summary: A brief description of the incident, including its duration, impact, and the affected services or systems.

Timeline: A chronological sequence of events, including when the issue was detected, how it was detected, actions taken, misleading paths explored during investigation, escalation to teams, and how the incident was ultimately resolved.

Root Cause and Resolution: Detailed explanations of what caused the issue and how it was fixed. This section often involves technical details and analysis.

Corrective and Preventative Measures: Suggestions for improvements or corrective actions to prevent similar issues in the future. This may include specific tasks or steps to address the root causes and enhance system resilience.

Reflection and Learning: A discussion of lessons learned from the incident, what worked well in the response, and what could be improved for future incident management.

The purpose of a postmortem is not only to diagnose the immediate problem but also to improve processes, systems, and procedures to prevent similar issues in the future. It encourages a culture of continuous improvement and learning from mistakes.
